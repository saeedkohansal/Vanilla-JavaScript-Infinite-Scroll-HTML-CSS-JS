Hello Programmers, Welcome to gilgeekify programming. My name is Saeed Kohansal, and I hope you have a great time. In this video, I will show you how to Implement web-based Infinite Scroll Feature using Vanilla JavaScript. With the Infinite Scrolling feature, you can improve the user experience for your website. Infinite Scrolling or Continuous Scrolling or also known as Endless Scrolling is a web design technique where, as the user scrolls down a page, more content automatically and continuously loads at the bottom, eliminating the user's need to click to the next page. Infinite scrolling minimizes interaction costs and increases user engagement, but it isn‚Äôt a good fit for every website. For some, pagination or a Load More button will be a better solution.
